Awaiting Power Cord Retainer Assembly, which should contain brass snap and screws for power cord strap.  Checked SMX, Problem description network comm error. BD Notified 08/05/19. Checked error log, multiple errors recorded 04/05/19, All 800.8000. \"The software has a fault\". 800.8000 also occurred in Feb 2019 and June 2018 and May 2018. Replace Logic Board. Current SW Version 9.12.40.4, ENSURE THAT THIS SW IS LOADED WHEN LOGIC BOARD IS REPLACED. Unsure where â€œNetwork Comm Errorâ€ description has come from. Photo of unit showing 600.6835 error (Wireless Dataset). Possible that Dataset was loaded/Software upgraded and the â€œWireless Network Disabledâ€ step wasnâ€™t taken. Error does not show in event log, Wireless Network Settings have since been disabled on ASM, so no issue here. Checked other GCPH PCUs in workshop for wireless status, if GCPH has wireless network then we would be able to copy network config which would negate the need to load a Dataset. Unfortunately, wireless network settings are disabled on other GCPH PCUs. Have emailed Dinh at GCPH in regards to getting a GCPH Dataset.",

Observed SF10, Sensor Shift Failures and Error During TCI in March 2019, SP3 in Jan 2019 (Control PCB). Control PCB or SW Reload evidently not done as we can still see previous events. PL3 in February 2018. Difficult to diagnose without knowing what action was taken in regards to previous errors. Internal inspection of rear case is good. Internal inspection of front case also good, no fluid ingress. Cracked Safety Lamp. Backplate replacement NOT required. Chassis thread for Chassis PCB stripped, therefore chassis replacement will be required. Further diagnosis required to figure out cause of SF3, take a Chassis PCB from another pump and rule out possible Chassis PCB failure.",

Perform careful inspection on ALL INTERNAL COMPONENTS whilst performing PSU and Mains inlet replacement for further possible replacement parts. Unsure what the rattle was, check all screws are tight. Check PCU Handle and pole clamp for possible fluid ingress. Inspect Power Cord Retainer for possible cracks. Replace SIO Board/Network Board Sticker thingy.

Removed chassis, removed entire barrel clamp assembly and re-seated everything. Installed Chassis first, followed by Barrel clamp, ensuring chassis was no longer sitting on top of barrel clamp potentiometer. Re-installed Internal Frame and ensured that Barrel Clamp was now operating smoothly. Successful re-installation. Photos and Video taken of Barrel Clamp smooth operation, uploaded to Dropbox.

Rear Case internally in good condition, no fluid ingress. Case Seal too short, replace. AC Filter Gasket torn, replace. Externally case is in perfect condition, no cracks around any screw points, very clean, Module Latch in good condition. Suspect recent Rear Case replacement. Pole clamp also in good condition, suspect recent replacement. SIO and Network Boards appear in good condition, much cleaner and gaskets in far better condition than other Royal Melbourne PCUs, replacements not required. Shouldnt even require cleaning. Mains shroud, Cord Wrap, Handle, Even IUIs are in good condition. Power Supply and Mains inlet have been thoroughly inspected by Luke, and are definitely not blown like the other RM PCUs. Front Case in good condition, no cracks/fluid ingress. Maybe replace LCD Gasket as looks weird from outside. Verified output of PSU 25 V DC with Multimeter. Verified suspected failure of Power Supply Board using multimeter to compare output to Battery of Old Board with New Board from cupboard. Luke installed replacement Power Supply Board TC10006929.",

Experimented with workshop PCUs and found that \"Wireless Connection\" is always greyed out until a Network Config is loaded onto PCU, at which point Wireless Connection allows the user to toggle between Enable and Disable. Check Error Log for more 600 errors over the next few days, otherwise assume that Logic Board replacement has resolved 600 issues. Return PCU to customer with \"Hospital Dataset Loaded\" box checked, however write a note that Wireless Network config is not loaded. Luke experienced issue with PCU failing to charge following Logic Board replacement. Dis-assembled and re-assembled to check all cables plugged in. PCU now charges. PCU arrived from customer with \"Confirmed Not Charging\" fault. Potential intermittent keypad fault causing charging issues, replacement Front Case has been installed by Luke. Await Left Support Frame and if 600 error does not occur again, disregard network board replacement. ",

        "comment": "Hi Leanne and the RFDS Cairns team\r\nIve taken a look at the unit, and have not seen any obvious problems.\r\n\r\nPossible causes:\r\n1 . Latching alarms \r\nZolls have latching alarms, meaning that an Asystole / VT / VF alarm will persist on the screen until it has been cleared by the user (by pressing the alarm silence button). If you are doing a dump test in the morning it may trigger an asystole alarm that will stay on the screen even if the dummy load has been removed and the ECG leads are hooked up to a perfectly healthy patient until the alarm is cleared.\r\n\r\n2. Dry / Expired ECG Dots\r\nThe heat and humidity of Cairns may be interfering with the gel on the dots. If you can store the dots in their original packaging you may find they last longer and have less issues.We find this is one of the leading causes of problems with ECG readings for the QAS. \r\n\r\nIf you do not believe either of these to be the cause, I am happy to get a quote for a new ECG lead and side panel where the ECG lead connects. The front panel also has some cracking where it meets the rear case and could be replaced to prevent any future fluid ingress if it gets worse (picture below). \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions or want to proceed with a front/side panel replacement and new ECG leads and I will get back to you with a quote.",

Checked error log and revealed recent error code- 240.4140.0 and 240.4150.0 as reported, which is related to pressure sensors. So, pressure sensors need to be replaced. Error log also revealed error - 245.3020, which is related to the door sensor failure. P1 Inspection: IUI Pass, Platen Pass, Dim segment verified on LED as fault reported . Internal inspection revealed no fluid ingress. Physical inspection revealed door latch and sear are in good condition. Pump latch/unlatch properly. AIL sensor, Motor, motor mount is in good condition. Front door was found cracked, need to replace .TODO: replace Pump Door, replace LED and replace both pressure sensors.\r\n",
